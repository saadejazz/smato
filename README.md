# SMATO - Image-based Pedestrian Smartphone Usage Classification

In today's digital age, it is becoming increasingly common to witness pedestrians engrossed in their smartphones while navigating through bustling traffic or its vicinity [[1]](#1). Although regulations surrounding smartphone usage by drivers are prevalent in many countries, the impact of smartphone distraction on pedestrians should not be overlooked. Studies have revealed that smartphone use among pedestrians significantly hampers their situational awareness and attentiveness, consequently increasing the likelihood of accidents and injuries [[2]](#2). With the world gradually shifting towards autonomous driving, it is imperative to incorporate advanced safety measures that can identify smartphone usage among pedestrians. Leveraging widely available sensors like cameras, it becomes feasible to detect instances of smartphone engagement and take additional precautions. To facilitate this endeavor, this repository presents a carefully curated dataset and transfer-learning-based classifier.

## Sourcing the Dataset

The dataset utilized for this project has been compiled from various publicly available pedestrian datasets that encompass a wide range of images depicting pedestrians in diverse ambient environments, orientations, and engagements. These datasets include prominent sources such as PETA [[3]](#3), ...

To ensure the dataset's comprehensiveness, an additional collection of images was obtained through Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) techniques, specifically by leveraging image search functionalities provided by platforms like Google and Bing (). This process facilitated the inclusion of images captured under varying lighting conditions and camera angles. In order to augment the dataset, most images were flipped horizontally, which effectively doubled the dataset's size while maintaining its diversity and correctness.

All images underwent a preliminary step of pedestrian isolation. This was achieved by employing a person detector, specifically [OpenPifPaf]. By accurately detecting and segmenting pedestrians within the images, the subsequent annotation process was applied. The annotation process itself followed an iterative approach to gradually improve the dataset's quality and inclusiveness. It commenced with the curation of a small initial dataset, which was used to train an initial classifier. With this classifier in place, additional images were sourced from a variety of different sources. Subsequently, the previously trained classifier was utilized to automatically annotate these newly acquired images. However, to ensure accuracy, manual inspection of the annotations was conducted to identify any misclassifications (as the dataset grew in size, it was expected that the number of misclassifications would decrease). This manual inspection of misclasification also presented an opportunity to analyze the reasons behind misclassifications - knowledge that influenced future data sourcing strategies or inform adjustments to the model building process. The iterative nature of this approach, involving constant refinement through training, data sourcing, and manual inspection, ensured the dataset's continuous improvement, ultimately leading to a more reliable and comprehensive resource for smartphone usage detection in pedestrian images.
